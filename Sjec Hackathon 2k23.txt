Our project is based on the bus transport management system. It is a computerized system that involves managing and operating the workflow of buses.
This project helps to deliver the relevance and importance of a bus transport management system since it is frequently used in Mangalore for travelling
from place to place within the city as well as outside the city. It is projected towards enhancing the relationship between customers and the buses,
thereby making it convenient for customers to book buses and to track it with ease. It also caters to the passenger’s safety and comfort by providing easy
and free cancellation of reservations. We chose this topic because of the ever-growing demand for bus transportation. Hence, there was a need for convenient
 booking of buses and an effective computerized administrative system which tracks these buses. It is a user-friendly application which generates a unique
PNR number for all passengers and assures a reliable service. The bus transport management system contains a database of reservations and tickets issued to
provide regular service in and around Mangalore. Since the details of the passengers will be stored in a database, the data will be safe and confidential.
Some aspects which will be covered in this project are as follows: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Google Maps API, CSV and Python.
